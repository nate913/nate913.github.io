      Hello my name is Nate I'm thirty years old from Kansas City Kansas. I graduated from Washington high school in 2007 and after high school I started working at General Motors.</p>
          <p>While at GM i felt unfulfilled and i started to question my life. After thinking about my future i decided to go back to school to further my education.</p>
          <p>That's what brought me to the coding program. Coding seemed like a useful skill to me, especially in today's tech age.</p>
